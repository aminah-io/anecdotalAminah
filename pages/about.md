Lived experiences create the whole human. This is a place where I talk about my lived experiences, and maybe just maybe, you will find comfort in the similarities we share or the differences that make each of us unique. 

## Examination of Anecdotal Experiences

Anecdotes are frowned upon in the scientific community. Why? Because it is near impossible to replicate an anecdotal experience. I love science, and I believe that when done with pure intention, it allows us to understand our physical reality. Anecdotal experiences, while lacking in the ability to replicate through scientific observation, still have their rightful place in the world. Anecdotes shed light on an individual's very real lived experiences. We can't all be scientifically observed to see if we're telling the truth about our experiences or not, and it would be weird to suggest it as a possibility. 

The thing I love the most about anecdotes is that it lets us see a person for who they are. Even if they aren't telling the truth, we at least get to see the colorful stories they're able to weave.

## My Anecdotes

Contrary to some beliefs about anecdotes in relation to truthful experience sharing, my anecdotes are based on my own lived experiences. No storytelling happening here. One of the things I dislike about religion is that, instead of experiencing life on one's own terms, many people use the experiences of the individuals in religious texts to base their lives and decisions on. 

My hope with this blog is to let you know, where we share similar experiences, that you're not alone. And in our differences, that there are many different ways to experience one thing or another. If you can walk away with one of those two, then my job here is done.

## Medical Advice

Holistic health and well-being are two very important topics in my life, both in the physical realm as well as the mental/psychological realm. Some of my anecdotes will be related to my own experiences with medicine, alternatice & complementary healing, healing through food and supplements, and spirituality as the foundation of my mental health.

While I do firmly believe in my experiences and how I've been able to heal myself through research/assistance from functional medicine doctors, these anecdotes in no way serve as medical advice. If you are experiencing medical issues, please see a doctor in the field which your issue necessitates. 

## Anecdotal Aminah

My name is Aminah and I am your resident anecdote antidote. In a world where many opinions exist, some without actual basis in experience or reality, it is difficult to find what we are looking for. I believe that when we search and allow ourselves to be properly guided, we will find exactly what we are looking for. 

If you were guided here, welcome. 

If you came here consciously through your own efforts, welcome.

May you leave here with a new understanding of yourself through the words you find in this blog.
